# Portfolio Site

Welcome! 👋  
This is my personal portfolio website—a living, evolving space where I share my journey as a software engineer, my technical interests, and the projects that excite me. My goal is to present not just what I’ve done, but how I think, learn, and build.

## 🌱 My Thought Process

When designing this site, I wanted it to be more than a digital resume. I aimed for a platform that reflects my values: clarity, accessibility, and continuous improvement. Every section is crafted to tell a story—not just of achievements, but of growth, curiosity, and collaboration.

- **User Experience First:** I believe a portfolio should be easy to navigate and enjoyable to explore. That’s why I prioritized a clean, responsive design with dark mode support.
- **Transparency:** I openly share my learning process, including both successes and challenges. This site is a snapshot of my current skills and a roadmap for where I’m headed.
- **Open Source Spirit:** I’m passionate about contributing to the community. The codebase is structured for maintainability and scalability, following best practices I’ve learned from real-world experience.

## 🚀 Features

- **About Me:** Dive into my background—education, publications, leadership, and open-source work. I highlight not just what I did, but why it mattered.
- **Experience:** A detailed timeline of my roles at Polaris Wireless, Apple, Walmart, Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, and Honda Innovations. Each entry focuses on impact, collaboration, and the technologies that shaped my approach.
- **Projects:** *(Coming soon)* I’ll be curating a list of personal and open-source projects, each with insights into my design decisions and lessons learned.
- **Responsive Design:** Built with [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) and [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) for seamless performance on any device.
- **Modern UI:** Accessible, visually appealing, and easy to use—because good design is as important as good code.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack & Rationale

- **Framework:** [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/)  
  *Why?* For its flexibility, performance, and strong support for modern web standards.
- **Styling:** [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/)  
  *Why?* Utility-first CSS keeps styles consistent and maintainable.
- **Icons:** [Lucide React](https://lucide.dev/)  
  *Why?* Clean, customizable icons that fit the site’s aesthetic.
- **TypeScript:**  
  *Why?* Type safety helps prevent bugs and makes the codebase easier to scale.
- **CI/CD:**  
  *Note:* My experience with CI/CD is highlighted in the portfolio, though this repo doesn’t include a pipeline yet. I’m always looking for ways to automate and improve workflows.

## 🏃 Development

This project uses [Bun](https://bun.sh/) as the package manager and runtime. Do not use npm or yarn.

```bash
bun install              # install dependencies
bun run dev              # start dev server (Next.js)
bun run build            # run tests then build for production
bun run start            # start production server
bun run test             # run tests
bun run lint             # run ESLint
bun run resize-logo      # (optional) resize public/logo.png to 256×256 for performance
bun run generate-favicons # (optional) regenerate favicons from public/logo.png
```

## 📂 Project Structure

The codebase is organized for clarity and scalability. I separate concerns by feature, use modular components, and follow best practices for maintainability.  
*(See the `/components`, `/pages`, and `/styles` directories for details.)*

---

## ⚡ Performance

- **Logo:** If `public/logo.png` is very large (e.g. 4096×4096), run `bun run resize-logo` (uses `sharp` from devDependencies). This resizes to 256×256 and reduces payload; a backup is saved as `public/logo-original.png`. Then run `bun run generate-favicons` if you use custom favicons.

## 💡 What’s Next?

- Add a Projects section with write-ups on my favorite builds.
- Share more about my open-source contributions and what I learned from them.
- Continue refining the UI/UX based on feedback and new ideas.
